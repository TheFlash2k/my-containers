# PWN-CHAL:CPP

This is just a tag of the `pwn-chal` container. Everything else is the same, the only thing that's different is that it has `g++` installed, which install the `libstd++` and `libc++` which is required for running the binaries written in C++.

You can find more about the usage for this on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/theflash2k/pwn-chal/)
